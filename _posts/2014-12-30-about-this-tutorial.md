This tutorial provides a beginner's introduction to installing,
configuring and using Ardour for basic sound recording and editing
tasks. The main body of the manual was written during a **Book Sprint**
led by Derek Holzer in the moddr\_lab
([http://moddr.net](http://moddr.net "moddr_lab @ WORM, Rotterdam")) at
WORM in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, between 23 and 27 November 2009,
with input and support from the international community of Ardour users
and developers. This new version of the manual updates the text and
screenshots to the current version of Ardour (3.5.403 at the time of
writing).

This FLOSS manual complements the Ardour reference manual currently
under development by the Ardour community, which aims to provide an
encyclopedic listing of Ardour's features. That reference manual can be
found at [http://manual.ardour.org/](http://manual.ardour.org/).

The Ardour community is invited to contribute content to this manual.
The interface to edit or add new chapters is located at

Conventions Used in This Manual
-------------------------------

Below are some basic conventions we have adopted in this manual.

### Mouse Clicks

Ardour requires a two-button mouse to run (or the emulation of that on
your system in some other way). A **Click** is assumed to be a left
button mouse click. A **Right Click** refers to the right-hand button on
the mouse. A *"Control"*, *"Cmd"* or *"Apple"* key pressed with a mouse
Click is not the same, and may in fact give a different result.

### Key Names & Combinations

The names of keys to be pressed are written in quotation marks and
italicised, like this:

*"Control", "Return", "Backspace", "R"*

Key combinations are written like this:

*"Control" + "X"*

or

*"Apple" + "X"*

### Menu Navigation

Many functions are accessible in Ardour by clicking on the various menu
items. Additionally you may need to access functions through the menus
of OS X, Ubuntu, or other Linux distributions. To illustrate this we use
two conventions: the first is illustration via screenshots (images), and
the second is through a **Syntax** like this :

*System \> Administration \> Synaptic Package Manager*

The above example is shorthand for "first click on the System menu, then
choose the Administration item of the list, and then click on Synaptic
Package Manager".

### Glossary Words

FLOSS Manuals does not assume any previous knowledge of computers or
audio editing, so terms which might be unfamiliar to the general reader
are capitalized throughout this manual, and are listed in **Boldface**
the first time they are used in a chapter. Glossary words are also
defined in-line the first time they occur in the manual, and are
included in the **Glossary** at the end of this manual.
